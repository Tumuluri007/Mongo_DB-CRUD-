Here's a detailed description you can use for your GitHub repository:
**MongoDB CRUD Operations with Python**
This repository demonstrates how to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database using Python and the PyMongo driver.** The code provides a comprehensive guide for developers looking to integrate MongoDB with their Python applications.
**Key Features:**
MongoDB Connection: Establishes a connection to a local MongoDB instance using PyMongo.
Database and Collection Management: Shows how to access and manipulate databases and collections.
CRUD Operations: Detailed examples of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
**Technologies Used:**
Python 3.6 - 3.11
PyMongo driver
MongoDB (local instance)
**Code Structure:**
Importing and Initializing:
Imports the MongoClient from PyMongo.
Initializes a client connection to the local MongoDB server.
**Database and Collection Access:**
Demonstrates how to list and access databases.
Shows how to access and list collections within a database.
**CRUD Operations:**
Create: Uses insert_one() to add a new document to a collection.
Read: Utilizes find_one() to retrieve a document from the collection.
Update: Employs update_one() to modify an existing document.
Delete: Implements delete_one() to remove a document from the collection.
**Usage:**
Each operation is clearly commented and can be run independently. Users can modify the queries and document structures to fit their specific use cases.
**Important Notes:**
The code assumes a local MongoDB instance running on the default port (27017).
Error handling and connection closing are not implemented in this basic example but should be considered for production use.
The examples use a test database and collection. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and adjust the database/collection names as needed.
